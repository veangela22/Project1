          <p>
            Since its founding in 1895, The New York Public Library has
            unwaveringly served New York City, no matter the circumstances. The
            COVID-19 pandemic brought forth unprecedented challenges for our
            city and our patrons. But as it has always done, the Library quickly
            adapted to ensure communities could still access the information and
            resources they needed. While constantly monitoring the rapidly
            changing circumstances, the Library increased its core digital
            services—from e-book access to online learning support for students,
            remote research services, online programs, and virtual one-on-one
            job support. And as soon as it could, the Library reopened all
            available branch locations across the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten
            Island in phases to ensure that New Yorkers could access the
            services and resources they rely on. <br />
            <br />
            Library was founded on the ideals of free and open access to
            knowledge and opportunity for everyone. The challenges of 2020 and
            2021 did not deter, but rather reaffirmed NYPL’s central objective
            to serve New Yorkers through even the most turbulent times—a
            testament to the enduring legacy of the Library as one of the city’s
            most essential civic institutions.
